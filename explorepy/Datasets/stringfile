Around the 1970s/1980s the term information engineering methodology (IEM) was created to
describe database design and the use of software for data analysis and processing.[3][4] These techniques were
intended to be used by database administrators (DBAs) and by systems analysts based upon an understanding of the operational
processing needs of organizations for the 1980s. In particular, these techniques were meant to help bridge the
gap between strategic business planning and information systems. A key early contributor
(often called the "father" of information engineering methodology) was the Australian Clive Finkelstein,
who wrote several articles about it between 1976 and 1980, and also co-authored an influential Savant Institute
report on it with James Martin.[5][6][7] Over the next few years, Finkelstein continued work in a more
business-driven direction, which was intended to address a rapidly changing business environment; Martin
continued work in a more data processing-driven direction. From 1983 to 1987, Charles M. Richter, guided by
Clive Finkelstein, played a significant role in revamping IEM as well as helping to design the IEM software
product (user data), which helped automate IEM.
